                    Welcome to the Quiz Game! In this game, you will get a series of
                    questions, each one with 4 possible answers. Only 1 out of the 4
                    answers is correct. If you answer wrongly to any of the questions, you
                    lose! You win if you manage to answer correctly to all questions.
